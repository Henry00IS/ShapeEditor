    //The style attributes table describes design attributes that
    //distinguish font-style variants within a font family. 
    //It also provides associations between those attributes and 
    //name elements that may be used to present font options within application user interfaces.

    //The style attributes table is also recommended for all new, non-variable fonts,    //
    //especially if fonts have style attributes in axes other than weight, width, or slope.

If newer versions of the other fonts include the information themselves and are present, then this record is ignored.
            //0x0002  ELIDABLE_AXIS_VALUE_NAME        If set, it indicates that the axis value represents the “normal” value for the axis and may be omitted when composing name strings.
            //0xFFFC  Reserved                        Reserved for future use — set to zero.

            //If a previously - released family is extended with fonts for style variations from a new axis of design variation, 
            //then all of them should include a OlderSiblingFontAttribute table for the “normal” value of earlier fonts.

            //The values in the different fonts should match; if they do not, application behavior may be unpredictable.

            // Note: When the OlderSiblingFontAttribute flag is set, that axis value table is intended to provide default information about other fonts in the same family,

            //The font should contain different axis value tables that do not use this flag to make declarations about itself.

            //The ElidableAxisValueName flag can be used to designate a “normal” value for an axis that should not normally appear in a face name.
            //For example, the designer may prefer that face names not include “Normal” width or “Regular” weight.
            //If this flag is set, applications are permitted to omit these descriptors from face names, though they may also include them in certain scenarios.

            //Note: Fonts should provide axis value tables for “normal” axis values even if they should not normally be reflected in face names.

            //Note: If a font or a variable-font instance is selected for which all axis values have the ElidableAxisValueName flag set, 
            //then applications may keep the name for the weight axis, if present, to use as a constructed subfamily name, with names for all other axis values omitted.

            //When the OlderSiblingFontAttribute flag is set, this will typically be providing information regarding the “normal” value on some newly-introduced axis.
            //In this case, the ElidableAxisValueName flag may also be set, as desired.When applied to the earlier fonts,
            //those likely would not have included any descriptors for the new axis, and so the effects of the ElidableAxisValueName flag are implicitly assumed.
