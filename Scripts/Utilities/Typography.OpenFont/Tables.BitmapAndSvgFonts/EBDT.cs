    //The EBDT table is used to embed monochrome or grayscale bitmap glyph data.
    //It is used together with the EBLC table,
    //which provides embedded bitmap locators, 
    //and the EBSC table, which provides embedded bitmap scaling information.

    //OpenType embedded bitmaps are also called “sbits” (for “scaler bitmaps”). 
    //A set of bitmaps for a face at a given size is called a strike.

    //The EBLC table identifies the sizes and glyph ranges of the sbits, 
    //and keeps offsets to glyph bitmap data in indexSubTables.

    //The EBDT table then stores the glyph bitmap data,
    //in a number of different possible formats.
    //Glyph metrics information may be stored in either the EBLC or EBDT table, 
    //depending upon the indexSubTable and glyph bitmap data formats.

    //The EBSC table identifies sizes that will be handled by scaling up or scaling down other sbit sizes.


    //The EBDT table is a super set of Apple’s Apple Advanced Typography (AAT) 'bdat' table.

            //There are also two different formats for glyph metrics:
            //big glyph metrics and small glyph metrics.
            //Big glyph metrics define metrics information 
            //for both horizontal and vertical layouts.
            //This is important in fonts(such as Kanji) where both types of layout may be used.
            //Small glyph metrics define metrics information for one layout direction only.
            //Which direction applies, horizontal or vertical, is determined by the flags field in the BitmapSize 
            //tables within the EBLC table.
